**What is it?**: PHP API is a templated API built in PHP, the functionality of this API is endless, from caching data to dynamic endpoint handling,
the template is built to allow changes.

**How does it work?**: The API uses local files as well as a remote database to create endpoints for the API, files can be stacked into folders to allow
a pathed URL. The permission system for this API allows keys to be able to access some routes, but not others, on top of that keys can also be disabled in
the database and all requests are logged.
